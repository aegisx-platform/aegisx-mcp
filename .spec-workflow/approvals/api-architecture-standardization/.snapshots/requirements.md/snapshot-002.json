This initiative will establish clear conventions for API organization, plugin patterns, URL routing, and module categorization that will serve as the foundation for all future API development.\n\n**Purpose**: Create comprehensive specifications that define how APIs should be structured, then systematically migrate existing code to follow these standards.\n\n**Value to Users**:\n- **Developers**: Clear guidelines for where code belongs, reducing decision fatigue and onboarding time\n- **New Team Members**: Faster ramp-up with self-documenting architecture\n- **Maintainers**: Easier to locate and modify code with predictable structure\n- **API Consumers**: Consistent, versioned URLs with backwards compatibility during migration\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature supports the technical foundation goals:\n- **Scalability**: Layer-based architecture enables independent scaling of infrastructure, platform services, and business domains\n- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns reduces cognitive load and makes codebase changes safer\n- **Developer Experience**: Standardized patterns and CRUD generator alignment reduce repetitive decision-making\n- **Quality**: Consistent structure enables better testing, code review, and automated quality checks\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Layer-Based Directory Structure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear layer-based directory structure (Core/Platform/Domains), so that I immediately know where to find or place code based on its purpose.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN examining the API codebase THEN developers SHALL find three distinct layers: `apps/api/src/layers/{core,platform,domains}`\n2. IF a module provides infrastructure services (auth, monitoring, logging) THEN it SHALL reside in `layers/core/`\n3. IF a module provides shared services used by multiple domains (users, files, settings) THEN it SHALL reside in `layers/platform/`\n4. WHEN a module contains business-specific logic (inventory, HR, finance) THEN it SHALL reside in `layers/domains/`\n5. WHEN migrating a module THEN the system SHALL support both old and new locations simultaneously with zero downtime\n\n### Requirement 2: Module Categorization Rules\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear rules for categorizing modules, so that I can confidently decide where new code belongs without consulting others.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN creating a new module THEN developers SHALL have access to a decision tree that categorizes it as Core, Platform, or Domain\n2. IF a module decorates the Fastify instance or manages infrastructure THEN it SHALL be categorized as Core\n3. IF a module is used by 2+ domains and provides shared functionality THEN it SHALL be categorized as Platform\n4. WHEN a module serves a single business domain THEN it SHALL be categorized as Domain\n5. WHEN categorization is ambiguous THEN documentation SHALL provide concrete examples for edge cases\n\n### Requirement 3: Plugin Pattern Standardization\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear guidelines on when to use `fastify-plugin` wrapper versus plain async functions, so that I write consistent, maintainable plugins.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN creating an infrastructure plugin that decorates `fastify` instance THEN developers SHALL use `fastify-plugin` (fp) wrapper\n2. WHEN creating a domain aggregator plugin that registers child plugins THEN developers SHALL use fp wrapper\n3. WHEN creating a leaf module with routes/controllers THEN developers SHALL use plain async function (no fp wrapper)\n4. IF a plugin needs to declare dependencies THEN it SHALL use fp wrapper with dependencies array\n5. WHEN plugin violates encapsulation rules THEN automated linting SHALL flag it during code review\n\n### Requirement 4: URL Routing Standard\n\n**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent, versioned URL patterns, so that I can predict endpoint locations and safely upgrade when new API versions are released.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN accessing any API endpoint THEN the URL SHALL follow pattern `/api/v1/{layer}/{resource}`\n2. IF endpoint belongs to Core layer THEN URL SHALL start with `/api/v1/core/` (example: `/api/v1/core/auth/login`)\n3. IF endpoint belongs to Platform layer THEN URL SHALL start with `/api/v1/platform/` (example: `/api/v1/platform/users`)\n4. WHEN endpoint belongs to Domain layer THEN URL SHALL start with `/api/v1/domains/` (example: `/api/v1/domains/inventory/drugs`)\n5. IF consumer calls old URL pattern (e.g., `/api/users`) THEN system SHALL redirect (HTTP 307) to new pattern (e.g., `/api/v1/platform/users`)\n6. WHEN redirection occurs THEN system SHALL preserve HTTP method and request body\n\n### Requirement 5: Backwards Compatibility During Migration\n\n**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want old API endpoints to continue working during migration, so that I can upgrade my client at my own pace without breaking production systems.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN migration begins THEN old routes SHALL remain functional for minimum 2 weeks\n2. IF consumer calls old route THEN response SHALL include deprecation headers (`X-API-Deprecated`, `X-API-Sunset`)\n3. WHEN using deprecated route THEN system SHALL log usage metrics (route, client ID, timestamp)\n4. IF sunset date is reached THEN old routes SHALL return HTTP 410 Gone with migration guide URL\n5. WHEN feature flags are disabled THEN system SHALL immediately revert to old routing behavior\n\n### Requirement 6: CRUD Generator Alignment\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CRUD generator to create code following the new architecture standards, so that generated code is consistent with the standardized structure.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN running CRUD generator THEN it SHALL create files in layer-based structure (e.g., `layers/domains/{domain}/{type}/{table}/`)\n2. IF generating backend code THEN it SHALL use correct plugin pattern (fp for aggregators, plain async for leaf modules)\n3. WHEN generating routes THEN URLs SHALL follow `/api/v1/{layer}/{resource}` pattern\n4. IF developer specifies domain THEN generator SHALL create files in `layers/domains/{domain}/`\n5. WHEN generator creates code THEN all generated files SHALL pass existing linting and testing requirements\n\n### Requirement 7: Documentation and Training Materials\n\n**User Story:** As a developer (new or existing), I want comprehensive documentation with examples, so that I can understand and apply the architecture standards correctly.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN developers SHALL find 5 specification documents in `docs/architecture/api-standards/`\n2. IF reading architecture spec THEN it SHALL include directory structure, layer definitions, and categorization decision tree\n3. WHEN reading plugin pattern spec THEN it SHALL include templates, examples, and anti-patterns\n4. IF reading URL routing spec THEN it SHALL include pattern rules, versioning strategy, and migration examples\n5. WHEN reading CRUD generator spec THEN it SHALL document all template changes and CLI command updates\n6. IF reading migration guide THEN it SHALL provide step-by-step instructions with risk mitigation strategies\n\n### Requirement 8: Zero-Downtime Migration Process\n\n**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a migration process with zero downtime and rollback capability, so that production systems remain stable throughout the architecture change.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN migration starts THEN both old and new routes SHALL work simultaneously\n2. IF deployment fails THEN system SHALL automatically rollback to previous version within 5 minutes\n3. WHEN performance degrades (P95 latency > +10%) THEN system SHALL trigger automatic rollback\n4. IF error rate increases (> 1% 5xx errors) THEN automated monitoring SHALL alert DevOps team\n5. WHEN rollback is needed THEN disabling feature flag SHALL immediately restore old behavior\n\n### Requirement 9: Progress Tracking and Metrics\n\n**User Story:** As a project manager, I want visibility into migration progress and impact metrics, so that I can report status to stakeholders and make data-driven decisions.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN migration is in progress THEN dashboard SHALL show percentage of modules migrated per layer\n2. IF checking impact THEN metrics SHALL include: old route usage, new route adoption, error rates per route\n3. WHEN comparing performance THEN metrics SHALL show P95 latency before vs after migration for each endpoint\n4. IF migration is complete THEN success metrics SHALL be documented: zero incidents, performance maintained, timeline adherence\n5. WHEN developer onboarding occurs THEN time-to-first-PR metric SHALL be tracked before and after standardization\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each layer (Core/Platform/Domain) has single, well-defined purpose\n  - Core: Infrastructure only (no business logic)\n  - Platform: Shared services only (no domain-specific logic)\n  - Domains: Business logic only (no infrastructure concerns)\n- **Modular Design**: Modules within each layer are independently deployable and testable\n- **Dependency Management**: Strict dependency rules enforced:\n  - Core depends on: nothing (pure infrastructure)\n  - Platform depends on: Core only\n  - Domains depend on: Core + Platform (never Domain → Domain)\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Each module exposes TypeBox schemas for all API contracts\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Response Time**: P95 latency SHALL NOT increase by more than 5% during or after migration\n- **Route Aliasing Overhead**: HTTP 307 redirects SHALL add < 5ms to request time\n- **Plugin Registration**: Server startup time SHALL NOT increase by more than 10%\n- **Database Queries**: No additional database queries introduced by architecture changes\n- **Memory Usage**: Heap memory SHALL NOT increase by more than 10% after migration\n\n### Security\n\n- **No Security Regressions**: All existing security controls (authentication, authorization, rate limiting) SHALL remain functional\n- **Route Aliasing Safety**: Redirects SHALL preserve authentication headers and request bodies\n- **Audit Logging**: All route aliases SHALL be logged for security auditing\n- **Permission Inheritance**: New layer structure SHALL NOT bypass existing RBAC permissions\n- **Secrets Management**: No credentials or sensitive data in new configuration files\n\n### Reliability\n\n- **Zero Production Incidents**: Migration SHALL NOT cause any production outages or data loss\n- **Automated Testing**: 100% of existing tests SHALL pass after each migration batch\n- **Canary Deployment**: Each batch SHALL roll out to 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% of traffic with monitoring\n- **Rollback Capability**: Rollback to previous version SHALL complete within 5 minutes\n- **Data Integrity**: All database operations SHALL maintain ACID properties throughout migration\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Developer Experience**: New module creation time SHALL decrease by 30% (measured by time from idea to working endpoint)\n- **Onboarding Time**: New developer time-to-first-PR SHALL decrease by 40%\n- **Code Discoverability**: Developers SHALL find relevant code 50% faster using layer-based structure (measured by grep/search time)\n- **Error Messages**: Plugin registration errors SHALL include helpful hints about correct layer placement\n- **Documentation Quality**: Documentation SHALL be reviewed and approved by at least 2 senior developers before implementation begins\n\n### Maintainability\n\n- **Code Duplication**: No code duplication between old and new implementations (use shared modules during transition)\n- **Consistent Patterns**: All new code SHALL follow established templates (100% adherence measured by code review)\n- **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve existing test coverage (currently 80%+ for critical paths)\n- **Linting Enforcement**: New plugin patterns SHALL be enforced via ESLint rules\n- **Breaking Changes**: Zero breaking changes to public APIs (internal refactoring only)\n\n### Scalability\n\n- **Horizontal Scaling**: Layer-based architecture SHALL support independent scaling of Core, Platform, and Domain services\n- **Load Balancing**: Route aliasing SHALL work correctly behind load balancers and proxies\n- **Caching**: Layer separation SHALL enable more effective caching strategies (Core/Platform can cache aggressively)\n- **Service Mesh Ready**: Structure SHALL be compatible with future microservices migration\n- **Database Connections**: No increase in database connection pool usage\n\n### Observability\n\n- **Migration Metrics**: Real-time dashboards SHALL track old vs new route usage\n- **Error Attribution**: Errors SHALL be tagged with layer/module for easier debugging\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Each layer SHALL have separate performance metrics (Core, Platform, Domain)\n- **Distributed Tracing**: Route aliases SHALL preserve trace context across redirects\n- **Logging Standards**: All logs SHALL include layer and module context\n",
