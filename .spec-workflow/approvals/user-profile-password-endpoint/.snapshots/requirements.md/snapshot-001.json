The primary issue is a missing password change endpoint that prevents users from updating their credentials through the documented API. Additionally, there are undocumented endpoints and incomplete error response schemas that reduce API reliability and usability.\n\n**Purpose:** Ensure the User Profile API is complete, secure, and fully documented according to its published contract.\n\n**Value to users:**\n- Enable secure password changes through the API\n- Provide comprehensive error handling for better debugging\n- Ensure API documentation matches implementation for reliable integration\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature supports the platform's commitment to:\n- **Security:** Enable users to change passwords securely with proper validation\n- **Developer Experience:** Complete API documentation reduces integration errors\n- **API-First Development:** Maintain contract-implementation alignment as per project standards\n- **Reliability:** Comprehensive error schemas improve error handling and debugging\n\nReference: This aligns with the API-First Development standard documented in `docs/guides/development/api-calling-standard.md`.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-1: Password Change Endpoint Implementation\n\n**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to change my password through the API, so that I can maintain account security and update credentials when needed.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user submits a valid password change request THEN the system SHALL validate the current password, verify new password strength (minimum 8 characters), confirm password match, hash the new password, update the database, and return success\n2. IF the current password is incorrect THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with message \"Current password is incorrect\"\n3. IF the new password does not meet strength requirements THEN the system SHALL return a 422 validation error with specific password requirements\n4. IF newPassword and confirmPassword do not match THEN the system SHALL return a 422 validation error with message \"Passwords do not match\"\n5. WHEN a password is successfully changed THEN the system SHALL invalidate existing sessions (optional security measure) and return success message\n6. The endpoint SHALL use POST method at path `/api/profile/password`\n7. The endpoint SHALL require JWT authentication via Bearer token\n8. The endpoint SHALL use TypeBox schema for request validation (ChangePasswordSchema)\n9. The endpoint SHALL follow project response format standard (success, data, message)\n\n#### Technical Requirements\n\n- Request body must include: `currentPassword`, `newPassword`, `confirmPassword`\n- Response must include status codes: 200 (success), 400 (invalid current password), 422 (validation errors), 401 (unauthorized)\n- Password hashing must use bcrypt or equivalent secure algorithm\n- Schema must be defined with TypeBox and exported for TypeScript type safety\n\n---\n\n### REQ-2: API Contract Documentation Completion\n\n**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want complete and accurate API documentation, so that I can integrate with all available endpoints correctly without surprises.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN reviewing the API contract THEN all implemented endpoints SHALL be documented including password change, activity logs, and account deletion\n2. IF an endpoint exists in implementation but not in contract THEN it SHALL be documented with full request/response schemas and authentication requirements\n3. Each documented endpoint SHALL include: HTTP method, path, authentication requirements, request schema, response schema (all status codes), and usage examples\n4. The contract SHALL document these endpoints:\n   - POST `/api/profile/password` - Change password (new)\n   - GET `/api/profile/activity` - Get activity logs (existing but undocumented)\n   - DELETE `/api/profile` - Delete account (existing but undocumented)\n5. The contract SHALL include TypeBox schema examples for all request/response bodies\n6. The contract SHALL specify all status codes: 200, 400, 401, 422, 500\n\n---\n\n### REQ-3: Error Response Schema Standardization\n\n**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent error response schemas for all endpoints, so that I can handle errors uniformly and provide better user feedback.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN any endpoint encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return a standardized error response format\n2. All endpoints SHALL define response schemas for error status codes: 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 422 (Validation Error), 500 (Internal Server Error)\n3. Error responses SHALL follow the format:\n   ```typescript\n   {\n     success: false,\n     error: {\n       code: string,\n       message: string,\n       details?: any\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n4. Validation errors (422) SHALL include field-specific error details\n5. Error schemas SHALL be defined with TypeBox for consistency\n6. The error response format SHALL match the standard documented in `docs/reference/api/api-response-standard.md`\n\n---\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Password change logic isolated in dedicated controller method\n- **Modular Design**: TypeBox schemas defined in separate schemas file, reusable across routes\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between password change implementation and other profile features\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Use TypeBox schemas as contracts between routes and controllers\n\n### Performance\n\n- Password hashing operations SHALL complete within 500ms to avoid blocking the event loop\n- Password validation SHALL use efficient regex patterns without catastrophic backtracking\n- Database queries SHALL use prepared statements and connection pooling\n\n### Security\n\n- Current password verification MUST occur before allowing password change\n- New passwords MUST be hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds >= 10\n- Password validation MUST enforce minimum 8 characters\n- Failed password change attempts SHOULD be logged for security monitoring\n- Consider rate limiting on password change endpoint (recommended: 5 attempts per hour)\n- Passwords MUST NOT be logged or exposed in error messages\n- JWT token validation MUST occur via `preValidation: [fastify.authenticate]`\n\n### Reliability\n\n- Password change endpoint SHALL have 99.9% uptime\n- Database transactions SHALL be atomic (rollback on failure)\n- Error responses SHALL be consistent and informative\n- All database operations SHALL have proper error handling\n\n### Usability\n\n- Error messages SHALL be clear and actionable (e.g., \"Password must be at least 8 characters\")\n- API documentation SHALL include working curl examples\n- TypeBox schemas SHALL provide helpful validation error messages\n- Response times SHALL be consistent (< 500ms for password operations)\n\n### Testability\n\n- Password change logic SHALL be unit-testable\n- Endpoint SHALL have integration tests covering:\n  - Successful password change\n  - Incorrect current password\n  - Weak new password\n  - Password mismatch\n  - Unauthorized access\n- Mock authentication SHALL be available for testing\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- ✅ POST `/api/profile/password` endpoint returns 200 for valid requests\n- ✅ Endpoint returns appropriate errors (400, 422) for invalid requests\n- ✅ All endpoints in implementation are documented in contract\n- ✅ All endpoints define error response schemas (400, 401, 422, 500)\n- ✅ API validation report shows 100% contract coverage\n- ✅ Frontend integration tests pass with new endpoint\n- ✅ Security audit confirms password handling best practices\n\n---\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset via email (separate feature)\n- Multi-factor authentication (separate feature)\n- Password history tracking (future enhancement)\n- Password strength meter UI (frontend feature)\n- Session invalidation on password change (optional, not critical)\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Existing authentication system (JWT + bcrypt)\n- Existing TypeBox schema infrastructure\n- Existing user profile database schema (users table with password field)\n- FastifyInstance and authentication strategies\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- API Contract: `docs/features/user-profile/api-contracts.md`\n- Implementation: `apps/api/src/layers/platform/user-profile/routes/profile.routes.ts`\n- Validation Report: Previous API contract validation (user-profile)\n- Standards:\n  - `docs/guides/development/api-calling-standard.md`\n  - `docs/reference/api/api-response-standard.md`\n  - `docs/reference/api/typebox-schema-standard.md`\n",
