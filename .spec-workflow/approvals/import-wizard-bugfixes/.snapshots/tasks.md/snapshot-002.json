  "content": "# Tasks Document: Import Wizard Bug Fixes\n\n## Summary\n4 bug fixes for the System Initialization Import Wizard\n\n---\n\n- [ ] 1. Fix file size display to use dynamic units\n  - File: `apps/web/src/app/features/system-init/components/import-wizard/import-wizard.dialog.ts`\n  - File: `apps/web/src/app/features/system-init/components/import-wizard/import-wizard.dialog.html`\n  - Update `fileInfo` computed signal to calculate dynamic units (B, KB, MB, GB)\n  - Remove hardcoded \" MB\" suffix from HTML template\n  - Purpose: Display correct file size for small files (currently shows \"0.00 MB\")\n  - _Leverage: ValidationResultsComponent.formattedFileSize pattern_\n  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_\n  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec import-wizard-bugfixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Angular Frontend Developer | Task: Fix the fileInfo computed signal in import-wizard.dialog.ts to use dynamic unit selection (B, KB, MB, GB) instead of always showing MB. Also update import-wizard.dialog.html to remove the hardcoded \" MB\" suffix. Reference ValidationResultsComponent.formattedFileSize for the pattern. | Restrictions: Do not change the return type structure of fileInfo, only change how size is calculated and displayed | _Leverage: apps/web/src/app/features/system-init/components/validation-results/validation-results.component.ts formattedFileSize getter | Success: Small files (<1KB) show as \"X.XX B\", medium files show as \"X.XX KB\", large files show as \"X.XX MB\". Test with departments_template.csv. | Instructions: First mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md by changing [ ] to [-], implement the fix, use log-implementation tool to record what was done, then mark as complete [x]_\n\n---\n\n- [ ] 2. Fix Excel template download async handling\n  - File: `apps/api/src/core/import/base/base-import.service.ts`\n  - Add `await` to `workbook.xlsx.writeBuffer()` call on line 205\n  - Change type assertion from `Promise<Buffer>` to `Buffer`\n  - Purpose: Fix Excel template download failing silently\n  - _Leverage: Other services using ExcelJS properly (budget-requests.service.ts)_\n  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_\n  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec import-wizard-bugfixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Node.js Backend Developer | Task: Fix the generateExcelTemplate method in base-import.service.ts line 205. Change `return workbook.xlsx.writeBuffer() as Promise<Buffer>` to properly await the buffer: `const buffer = await workbook.xlsx.writeBuffer(); return buffer as Buffer;` | Restrictions: Only modify line 205 and surrounding code if needed, do not change other parts of the file | _Leverage: apps/api/src/modules/inventory/budget/budgetRequests/budget-requests.service.ts for proper ExcelJS pattern | Success: Clicking \"Download Excel Template\" in Import Wizard successfully downloads a valid .xlsx file | Instructions: First mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md by changing [ ] to [-], implement the fix, use log-implementation tool to record what was done, then mark as complete [x]_\n\n---\n\n- [ ] 3. Fix validation step navigation async flow\n  - File: `apps/web/src/app/features/system-init/components/import-wizard/import-wizard.dialog.ts`\n  - Make `nextStep()` method async\n  - Add `await` before `validateFile()` call\n  - Add check after validation to only proceed if `canProceedToNextStep()` is true\n  - Purpose: Fix \"Ready to validate\" stuck state - user cannot proceed after validation\n  - _Leverage: Existing validateFile() method which is already async_\n  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_\n  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec import-wizard-bugfixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Angular Frontend Developer | Task: Fix the nextStep() method in import-wizard.dialog.ts (lines 417-428). Make it async and await the validateFile() call. After validation, check if canProceedToNextStep() returns true before incrementing the step. This ensures the validation completes before transitioning to the results view. | Restrictions: Do not change the logic of canProceedToNextStep() or validateFile(), only fix the async flow in nextStep() | _Leverage: The existing async validateFile() method in the same file | Success: User can successfully validate a file and proceed to Step 4 when validation passes. Test with /Users/sathitseethaphon/Downloads/departments_template.csv | Instructions: First mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md by changing [ ] to [-], implement the fix, use log-implementation tool to record what was done, then mark as complete [x]_\n\n---\n\n- [ ] 4. Disable Import History & Settings buttons with tooltip\n  - File: `apps/web/src/app/features/system-init/pages/system-init-dashboard/system-init-dashboard.page.html`\n  - File: `apps/web/src/app/features/system-init/pages/system-init-dashboard/system-init-dashboard.page.ts`\n  - Add `[disabled]=\"true\"` and `matTooltip=\"Coming Soon\"` to both buttons\n  - Ensure `MatTooltipModule` is imported in the component\n  - Purpose: Indicate to users that these features are not yet implemented\n  - _Leverage: MatTooltipModule from Angular Material_\n  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_\n  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec import-wizard-bugfixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Angular Frontend Developer | Task: Update Import History and Settings buttons in system-init-dashboard.page.html (lines 22-30) to be disabled with a \"Coming Soon\" tooltip. Add [disabled]=\"true\" and matTooltip=\"Coming Soon\" attributes. Verify MatTooltipModule is imported in the component file. | Restrictions: Do not create new pages or dialogs, just disable the existing buttons | _Leverage: MatTooltipModule already available in Angular Material | Success: Both buttons appear disabled (grayed out) and show \"Coming Soon\" tooltip on hover | Instructions: First mark this task as in-progress in tasks.md by changing [ ] to [-], implement the fix, use log-implementation tool to record what was done, then mark as complete [x]_\n\n---\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\nAfter all tasks complete:\n1. Upload small file (<1KB) - verify size shows \"X.XX B\" or \"X.XX KB\"\n2. Download Excel template - verify .xlsx file downloads\n3. Upload CSV and validate - verify Next button works after validation\n4. Hover on History/Settings buttons - verify \"Coming Soon\" tooltip\n",
