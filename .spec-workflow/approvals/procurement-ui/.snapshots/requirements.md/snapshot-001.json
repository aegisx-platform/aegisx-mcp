  "content": "# Requirements Document - Procurement UI\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Procurement UI provides a complete Angular-based frontend for the INVS Modern Procurement system. It enables users to manage the entire procurement lifecycle from purchase request creation through goods receipt and payment tracking. The UI integrates with the Procurement API backend and supports real-time collaboration, bulk data import, and complex approval workflows.\n\n**Purpose**: Build a user-friendly, responsive Angular application for procurement operations using AegisX-UI components and Angular Material design system.\n\n**Value**: Streamlines procurement processes, reduces manual data entry through Excel/CSV import, provides real-time visibility into procurement status, and ensures compliance with budget controls and approval workflows.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature aligns with the INVS platform's vision of providing integrated hospital management by:\n- **Efficiency**: Reducing procurement cycle time through streamlined workflows and real-time updates\n- **Accuracy**: Preventing budget overruns and data entry errors through validation and automation\n- **Transparency**: Providing clear visibility into procurement status for all stakeholders\n- **Integration**: Seamlessly connecting procurement with budget, inventory, and payment systems\n- **User Experience**: Following Material Design principles and AegisX-UI standards for consistency\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-1: Purchase Request List and Management\n\n**User Story:** As a pharmacist, I want to view and manage all purchase requests in a filterable table, so that I can track requests and their approval status efficiently.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.
