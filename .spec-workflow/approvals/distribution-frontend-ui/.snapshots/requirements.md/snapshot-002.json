This Angular-based application integrates with the distribution-backend-api to deliver multi-level approval workflows, FIFO/FEFO lot tracking, and complete audit trails.\n\n**Purpose:** Enable efficient distribution management through intuitive UI workflows that support Ministry of Public Health compliance and ensure proper drug rotation using FIFO/FEFO logic.\n\n**Value to Users:**\n- Department staff can easily request drugs from pharmacy with real-time stock validation\n- Supervisors can review and approve distribution requests with clear visibility\n- Pharmacists can dispense drugs using guided FIFO/FEFO workflows with automatic lot selection\n- Department staff can confirm receipt and close distribution workflows\n- Inventory managers can track drug consumption by department for usage analysis\n- Finance officers can access distribution reports for cost allocation\n- Auditors can trace complete distribution history with lot-level traceability\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature aligns with INVS Modern's core objectives:\n\n1. **Streamline Procurement Process**: Reduces distribution request processing time by 50% through intuitive forms and automated workflows\n2. **Enhance Inventory Accuracy**: FIFO/FEFO lot tracking UI helps pharmacists dispense drugs before expiry (target: 30% reduction in expired drug waste)\n3. **Improve Budget Control**: Track drug consumption by department for accurate cost center allocation\n4. **Support Data-Driven Decisions**: Visual dashboards and reports enable informed inventory planning\n5. **Ensure Compliance**: Complete audit trail for all distribution transactions meets Ministry requirements\n\n**Technical Alignment:**\n- Angular 18+ with Signals for reactive state management\n- AegisX UI component library for consistent design\n- Angular Material components for enhanced UX\n- TailwindCSS for responsive styling\n- TypeScript strict mode for type safety\n- Integrates with distribution-backend-api (15 endpoints)\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-1: Distribution List View\n\n**User Story:** As a pharmacist, I want to view all distribution requests with status filtering, so that I can prioritize pending approvals and dispensing tasks.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **WHEN** user opens Distribution List page **THEN** system **SHALL** display:\n   -
