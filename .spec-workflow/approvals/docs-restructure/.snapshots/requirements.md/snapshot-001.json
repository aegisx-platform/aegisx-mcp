This restructuring project aims to create a standardized, maintainable documentation structure that:\n\n1. **Improves developer experience** - Easy to find, read, and contribute to documentation\n2. **Enables web documentation** - Ready for static site generators (VitePress, Docusaurus, MkDocs)\n3. **Establishes standards** - Consistent naming, structure, and metadata across all documentation\n4. **Reduces maintenance burden** - Clear organization reduces duplication and outdated content\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature supports the AegisX Platform's goal of being an enterprise-grade, developer-friendly monorepo by:\n\n- **Documentation as Code** - Treating documentation with the same standards as source code\n- **Knowledge Management** - Making institutional knowledge accessible and searchable\n- **Onboarding Acceleration** - New team members can quickly understand the system\n- **Quality Assurance** - Well-organized docs reduce support burden and improve code quality\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Standardized Directory Structure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear and consistent directory structure, so that I can quickly find the documentation I need without searching through multiple locations.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing the docs/ directory THEN the structure SHALL follow a clear Information Architecture with consistent depth (max 3 levels)\n2. WHEN looking for specific documentation types THEN each type SHALL have a dedicated, well-labeled section (guides/, reference/, features/, architecture/)\n3. WHEN exploring any subdirectory THEN it SHALL contain an index file (README.md or index.md) explaining its contents\n4. IF a directory contains multiple documents THEN it SHALL be organized by logical grouping (not by date or author)\n5. WHEN checking file locations THEN root-level files SHALL be limited to essential overview documents only\n\n### Requirement 2: Consistent Naming Conventions\n\n**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want consistent file naming rules, so that I can predict file locations and avoid naming conflicts.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN creating or renaming documentation files THEN filenames SHALL use lowercase-with-dashes.md format\n2. IF a document is an index/overview THEN it SHALL be named README.md or index.md (not INDEX.md or overview.md)\n3. WHEN naming feature documentation THEN it SHALL follow the pattern: feature-name/README.md, feature-name/api-reference.md, etc.\n4. IF a document has specific metadata THEN deprecated UPPERCASE.md names SHALL be renamed to lowercase-with-dashes.md\n5. WHEN checking filenames THEN abbreviations SHALL be expanded (CICD → ci-cd, RBAC → rbac)\n\n### Requirement 3: Web Documentation Metadata\n\n**User Story:** As a technical writer, I want documentation files to include proper frontmatter metadata, so that static site generators can build proper navigation and search indices.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN creating a new documentation file THEN it SHALL include YAML frontmatter with title, description, and category\n2. IF the document is part of a series THEN frontmatter SHALL include order/weight for navigation\n3. WHEN generating web documentation THEN frontmatter SHALL provide sufficient metadata for automatic ToC generation\n4. IF a document has authors or last updated date THEN this information SHALL be in frontmatter (not in content)\n5. WHEN using tags or categories THEN they SHALL follow a controlled vocabulary defined in docs/metadata-schema.md\n\n### Requirement 4: Clear Information Architecture\n\n**User Story:** As a new team member, I want documentation organized by user intent, so that I can find answers to \"how do I...\" questions quickly.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN looking for getting started information THEN it SHALL be in docs/getting-started/ directory\n2. IF searching for API documentation THEN it SHALL be in docs/reference/api/ or docs/features/{feature}/api-reference.md\n3. WHEN learning architecture concepts THEN it SHALL be in docs/architecture/ organized by layer (frontend/, backend/, database/)\n4. IF looking for development guides THEN it SHALL be in docs/guides/development/ (not scattered across multiple directories)\n5. WHEN checking infrastructure documentation THEN it SHALL be in docs/guides/infrastructure/\n6. IF searching for feature-specific docs THEN it SHALL be in docs/features/{feature}/ with consistent internal structure\n\n### Requirement 5: Deprecation and Archive Strategy\n\n**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want a clear process for handling outdated or historical documentation, so that current docs remain clean without losing historical context.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN documentation becomes outdated THEN it SHALL be moved to docs/archive/{year-quarter}/ with a deprecation notice\n2. IF a document is replaced by a newer version THEN the old version SHALL include a frontmatter redirect or notice\n3. WHEN archiving session notes THEN they SHALL be consolidated into quarterly archive files (ARCHIVE_{YEAR}_Q{N}.md)\n4. IF investigation or analysis documents are no longer relevant THEN they SHALL be archived, not deleted\n5. WHEN checking docs/sessions/daily/ THEN active sessions SHALL be no older than current quarter\n\n### Requirement 6: Documentation Index and Navigation\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a master documentation index, so that I can understand the full scope of available documentation at a glance.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN visiting docs/README.md THEN it SHALL provide a comprehensive overview with links to all major sections\n2. IF a section has multiple documents THEN it SHALL have a section index (e.g., docs/guides/README.md)\n3. WHEN browsing features THEN docs/features/README.md SHALL list all features with brief descriptions\n4. IF documentation has multiple entry points THEN the main README SHALL explain when to use each path\n5. WHEN generating web docs THEN navigation structure SHALL be derivable from directory structure and frontmatter\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each documentation file covers one specific topic or feature\n- **Modular Design**: Documentation sections are independent and can be read standalone\n- **Dependency Management**: Cross-references use relative links; no circular dependencies\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Each section's README.md serves as the interface/entry point\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Build Performance**: Documentation structure SHALL support incremental builds for web documentation generators\n- **Search Performance**: Flat enough structure to enable fast full-text search (max 3 directory levels)\n- **Load Time**: Individual documentation pages SHALL be under 200KB to ensure fast web loading\n\n### Security\n\n- **No Sensitive Data**: Documentation SHALL NOT contain passwords, API keys, or credentials\n- **Safe Examples**: Code examples SHALL use placeholder values (example.com, user@example.com)\n- **Access Control**: If private documentation exists, it SHALL be in a separate repository, not archived\n\n### Reliability\n\n- **Link Integrity**: All internal links SHALL be validated and remain functional after restructuring\n- **Version Control**: Git history SHALL be preserved during file moves (use `git mv`)\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy bookmark URLs SHALL redirect via CI/CD build process if possible\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Consistent Templates**: Each documentation type SHALL have a template (feature, API, guide, architecture)\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Overview → Details → Reference pattern for complex topics\n- **Visual Hierarchy**: Proper markdown heading levels (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections)\n- **Code Examples**: All code examples SHALL be syntax-highlighted and include language tags\n- **Diagrams**: Complex concepts SHALL include Mermaid diagrams or ASCII art where beneficial\n",
