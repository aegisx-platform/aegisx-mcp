It bridges the existing backend Department API (`/v1/platform/departments`) with frontend interfaces, enabling administrators to manage department hierarchies, assign users to departments, and display department affiliations on user profiles.\n\n**Value Proposition:**\n- **For Admins**: Centralized department management with hierarchical organization support\n- **For Department Managers**: Easy assignment and tracking of team members\n- **For Users**: Clear visibility of organizational structure and affiliations\n- **For System**: Maintains data integrity between users and departments across all modules\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature aligns with the platform's core architecture principles:\n- **Domain Separation**: Departments are platform-level resources (not domain-specific)\n- **Shared Infrastructure**: Departments are used across inventory, HR, and other domains\n- **Permission-Based Access**: RBAC integration for department management operations\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Supports complex organizational structures\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Admin Department Management Interface\n\n**User Story:** As a **System Administrator**, I want to **manage departments through a dedicated admin interface**, so that **I can maintain accurate organizational structure and hierarchy**\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN admin navigates to Admin > Platform > Departments THEN system SHALL display department list with hierarchical view\n2. WHEN admin views department list THEN system SHALL show dept_code, dept_name, parent department, active status, and action buttons\n3. WHEN admin clicks \"Add Department\" THEN system SHALL open modal/dialog with create form\n4. WHEN admin submits create form with valid data THEN system SHALL call POST /v1/platform/departments AND refresh list\n5. IF admin submits create form with duplicate dept_code THEN system SHALL display conflict error (409)\n6. WHEN admin clicks edit button on department THEN system SHALL open modal/dialog pre-filled with department data\n7. WHEN admin updates department THEN system SHALL call PUT /v1/platform/departments/:id AND refresh list\n8. WHEN admin clicks delete button THEN system SHALL show confirmation dialog\n9. WHEN admin confirms deletion AND department has no users THEN system SHALL call DELETE /v1/platform/departments/:id\n10. IF department has users assigned THEN system SHALL prevent deletion AND display error message\n11. WHEN admin toggles active/inactive status THEN system SHALL update is_active field\n12. WHEN viewing departments THEN system SHALL support filtering by active status, parent department\n13. WHEN viewing departments THEN system SHALL support searching by dept_code or dept_name\n14. WHEN viewing departments THEN system SHALL support pagination with 10/25/50/100 items per page\n\n#### UI Components Required\n\n- Department list table with hierarchy display (tree structure or nested rows)\n- Create department dialog/modal\n- Edit department dialog/modal\n- Delete confirmation dialog\n- Search and filter controls\n- Pagination controls\n- Active/inactive toggle switch\n\n#### Technical Requirements\n\n- Use existing DepartmentService from `apps/web/src/app/features/inventory/modules/departments/services/departments.service.ts`\n- Leverage AegisX UI components (ax-table, ax-dialog, ax-form-field)\n- Use Angular Material components (mat-table, mat-dialog, mat-form-field, mat-select)\n- Apply TailwindCSS for layout and spacing\n- Implement reactive forms with validation\n\n### Requirement 2: User Department Assignment\n\n**User Story:** As a **System Administrator**, I want to **assign departments to users during user creation and editing**, so that **users are correctly affiliated with their organizational units**\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.

WHEN admin selects department THEN system SHALL populate user.department_id field\n4. WHEN admin selects parent department THEN system SHALL show child departments in hierarchical dropdown\n5. IF admin leaves department field empty THEN system SHALL allow user creation without department (nullable field)\n6. WHEN admin edits existing user THEN system SHALL display current department pre-selected\n7. WHEN admin changes user's department THEN system SHALL call PUT /api/users/:id with new department_id\n8. WHEN admin views user list THEN system SHALL display department name column\n9. WHEN admin filters user list THEN system SHALL support filtering by department\n10. WHEN user is assigned to department THEN system SHALL validate department exists AND is_active=true\n\n#### UI Components Required\n\n- Department dropdown selector (hierarchical mat-select)\n- Department field in user create/edit forms\n- Department column in user list table\n- Department filter in user list\n\n#### Technical Requirements\n\n- Extend existing user forms with department field\n- Use GET /v1/platform/departments/dropdown API\n- Store department_id in users table\n- Display department name (not just ID) in user lists\n- Support hierarchical department selection (parent → child)\n\n### Requirement 3: Profile Department Display\n\n**User Story:** As a **User**, I want to **see my department affiliation on my profile**, so that **I can verify my organizational assignment**\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user views their profile THEN system SHALL display department information section\n2. IF user has department assigned THEN system SHALL show department name, code, and hierarchy path\n3. IF user has no department assigned THEN system SHALL display \"No department assigned\"\n4. WHEN user views department info THEN system SHALL show full hierarchy path (e.g., \"Engineering > Backend Team\")\n5. WHEN user's department is inactive THEN system SHALL display warning indicator\n6. WHEN user views profile THEN system SHALL fetch department details from GET /v1/platform/departments/:id\n7. IF department fetch fails THEN system SHALL gracefully show \"Department information unavailable\"\n\n#### UI Components Required\n\n- Department information card on profile page\n- Department hierarchy breadcrumb display\n- Warning indicator for inactive departments\n- Placeholder for users without departments\n\n#### Technical Requirements\n\n- Add department section to user profile component\n- Fetch department details using DepartmentService\n- Display hierarchical path (parent → child)\n- Handle null/missing department gracefully\n- Show visual indicators for active/inactive status\n\n### Requirement 4: Department Hierarchy Management\n\n**User Story:** As a **System Administrator**, I want to **manage department hierarchies with parent-child relationships**, so that **organizational structure is accurately represented**\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN admin creates department THEN system SHALL allow selecting parent department (nullable)\n2. WHEN admin selects parent department THEN system SHALL prevent circular references\n3. IF admin tries to set department as its own parent THEN system SHALL show validation error\n4. IF admin tries to set child department as parent THEN system SHALL show validation error\n5. WHEN admin views department list THEN system SHALL display hierarchy levels with indentation\n6. WHEN admin clicks \"View Hierarchy\" THEN system SHALL call GET /v1/platform/departments/hierarchy\n7.
