    <h2>Welcome to AegisX</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      AegisX is a modern design system that combines the best of Angular
      Material 3 with custom components inspired by Tremor. It provides a
      complete set of design tokens, components, and patterns to help you build
      enterprise-grade applications quickly and consistently.
    </p>

    <h2>What is AegisX Design System?</h2>
    <p>
      AegisX is not just a component library—it's a comprehensive design system
      that includes design tokens, typography scales, color palettes, and a
      complete set of UI components. Every element is carefully crafted to work
      together seamlessly, ensuring consistency across your entire application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Built on top of <strong>Angular Material 3</strong>, AegisX extends the
      foundation with additional components and patterns commonly needed in
      enterprise applications. Whether you're building dashboards, data tables,
      or complex forms, AegisX has you covered.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>

    <h3>Comprehensive Component Library</h3>
    <p>
      AegisX includes over 50+ components ranging from basic elements like
      buttons and inputs to complex components like data tables, date pickers,
      and charts. All components are built as
      <strong>standalone Angular components</strong> using the latest Angular
      features including Signals for reactive state management.
    </p>

    <h3>Design Token System</h3>
    <p>
      A complete design token system built with CSS custom properties provides:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Color tokens</strong> - Semantic colors with Zinc palette for
        better readability
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Typography tokens</strong> - Two complete typography systems (UI
        & Prose)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spacing tokens</strong> - Consistent spacing scale across all
        components
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shadow tokens</strong> - Elevation system for depth and
        hierarchy
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>
        <strong>AegisX Typography</strong> - Optimized for UI components with
        16px base size and 1.5 line-height. Perfect for dashboards, forms, and

        lets the content shine." - AegisX Design Principles
      </p>
    </blockquote>
